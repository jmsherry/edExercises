          <h2>The normal way</h2>
          <p>Content is static (ie it's not being shipped in by ajax), so binding javascript events to it is easy because it's there in the browsers system.</p>
          <div id="normal">
            <a href="#" class="triggerLink">Click Me!</a>

          <h2>Undelegated</h2>
          <p>Content in this pod is brought in by ajax, so the problem is that the DOM (HTML) loads and the javascript binds,
            but then this html turns up via ajax AFTER that, and so has nothing bound to it. If you click the links you'll see
            they don't work. #problem!!</p>

          <h2>Delegated</h2>
          <p>The link below is targeted by a delegated event, and so will work...</p>
